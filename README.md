<h1>ID24-TeamA</h1>

<h2>Fossil Jigsaw Puzzle</h2>

**Ideas**
- Projection mapping
- 3D printed? Plywood?
- Probably not bones but actual limbs
- Sensing tech (RFID?)
- Magnets for connection? Sockets and Brackets?
- Pins for communication?
- Tracking marker?
- 

**TODO**
- Figure out how building blocks communicate
- Orientation of blocks
- Projecting methods
-
